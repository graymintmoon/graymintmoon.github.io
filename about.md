				<h5 class="text_center">CODE + DESIGN + STRATEGY</h5>
				<p class="text_light">What's up! I'm Randy and I'm a Senior Web Developer with a gravitational pull towards front-end development and deep appreciation for design. In my career I've been very fortunate to work on major non-profit organization websites, along with full-stack software development during my years at IBM.</p>
				<p class='text_light'>When I'm not on my laptop, I love going on #familydates with my wife and our two boys, discovering new places and exposing the kids to new experiences.</p>
				<p class='text_light'>When it comes to the web, I personally feel like I've learned too much to just keep it between me and the companies I've worked for. That's why I'm here - to offer my skill set to help people who need it.</p>
				<p class='text_light'>Thanks for checkin' out our site and we hope to work with you soon!</p>

				<h5 class="text_center">DIGITAL MARKETING</h5>
				<p class="text_light">Hi, I'm Khristine. I'm an alternative educator, a holistic health enthusiast, a Minimalism and Feng Shui consultant, and the co-founder of Gray Mint Moon. One of my favorite facets of being an entrepreneur is exploring branding psychology. I'm fascinated by the strategies behind how to make brands lovable.</p>

				<p class="text_light">On a personal note, above all, I am my family's keeper. Those closest to me know I'm an instinctive nurturer. My favorite moments are laughing with my husband and two sons on our living room floor. I love traveling, learning languages, and practicing Kripalu yoga and Loving-Kindness meditation.</p>

				<p class="text_light">Balancing life as a homemaker and a businesswoman can be challenging, but I'm thankful for my full and vibrant life. The only addition that can possibly enrich my life even more is having a gentle giant Newfoundland pup named Bear. </p>
