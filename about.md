<h5 class="page_section_title text_center">Before Gray Mint Moon</h5>

<p>Since becoming a web developer, I've had the privilege of working on an extensive portfolio of high-profile clients and global enterprise web applications.</p>

<p>During my years at IBM, I worked as a Software Front-End Developer and helped to create the Whitewater Tools platform - an internal web application that allowed IBM teams to modernize their toolsets with products like GitHub, Slack, Mural, and InVision.</p>

<p>Today, I am a Senior Web Developer, and have returned to working with non-profit organizations. Currently, I'm the lead developer on the new Parkinson's Foundation website.</p>

<p>Having the opportunity to apply my experience towards meaningful client work has revealed a deeper purpose that I've been wanting to explore. I became inspired to devote my skills towards helping globally and socially conscious businesses establish their own web presence.</p>

<h5 class="page_section_title text_center">Creating Gray Mint Moon</h5>
<p>I like to think of Khristine and myself as a spiritual, holistic and alternative-minded couple. We promote holistic health, natural, and organic living, and this conscious lifestyle is something we hope to pass down to our boys.</p>

<p>In addition, we're also worldschoolers - we enjoy traveling the world as part of our children's education. We continue to strive for personal development and we realize that our most important responsibility is to deepen ourselves spiritually.</p>

<p>The summer of 2017 proved to be a major season of personal and professional growth for the both of us. Khristine's intuitions led her to follow her calling to extend her passions globally. So she created a heart-centered online business as a Minimalism and Feng Shui consultant for Mothers around the world.</p>

<p>Around the same time, I felt compelled to pursue an ongoing dream as well - to become a freelance web developer. For a long time I had been drawn to freelancing so I could work on projects and subjects that mean most to me. I especially wanted to leverage my expertise in front-end development with a specific client niche - holistic businesses.</p>

<p>Appropriately, we discovered the opportunity to intersect both our personal callings. I decided then, it was only fitting I develop websites with a focus on helping like-minded clients who also appreciate a holistic, natural lifestyle.</p>

<p>So on the fateful day of the total solar eclipse of 2017, when the Earth, Moon, and Sun wondrously aligned, we commemorated the rare celestial event by formally branding our businesses with lunar references - Lotus Light Moon and Gray Mint Moon.</p>

<p>This began the narrative of how our passion for wanting to help others crossed over into the business world. These endeavors were born by following our hearts and our intuitions, and by responding to the signs of the Universe.</p>

<h5 class="page_section_title text_center">Gray Mint Moon Ahead</h5>

<p>We look forward to being a part of a network of influencers and forward-thinkers who are motivated to shape a better future for the world.</p>
