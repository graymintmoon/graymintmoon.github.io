<h5 class="page_section_title text_center">Before Gray Mint Moon</h5>

<p>Since becoming a web developer, I've had the privilege of working on an extensive portfolio of high-profile clients and global enterprise web applications.</p>

<p>In my first role as an Associate Web Developer, I built websites, email campaigns, event donation forms, and customized features for national, non-profit organization websites. I've been able to serve major clients such as the Boston Children's Hospital, the Moody Foundation, and Freestore Foodbank.</p>

<p>During my years at IBM, I worked as a Software Front-End Developer and helped to create the Whitewater Tools platform - an internal web application that allowed IBM teams to modernize their toolsets with products like GitHub, Slack, Mural, and InVision.</p>

<p>Today, I am a Senior Web Developer, and have returned to working with non-profit organizations. Currently, I'm the lead developer on the new Parkinson's Foundation website.</p>

<p>Having the opportunity to apply my experience towards meaningful client work has revealed a deeper purpose that I've been wanting to explore. I became inspired to devote my skills towards helping globally and socially conscious entrepreneurs establish their own web presence.</p>

<h5 class="page_section_title text_center">Creating Gray Mint Moon</h5>
<p>I like to think of Khristine and myself as a spiritual, holistic and alternative-minded couple. We promote holistic health, natural, and organic living, and this conscious lifestyle is something we hope to pass down to our boys.</p>

<p>In addition, we're also worldschoolers - we enjoy traveling the world as part of our children's education. We continue to strive for personal development and we realize that our most important responsibility is to deepen ourselves spiritually.</p>

<p>The summer of 2017 proved to be a major season of personal and professional growth for the both of us. Khristine's intuitions led her to follow her calling to extend her passions globally. So she created a heart-centered online business as a Minimalism and Feng Shui consultant for Mothers around the world.</p>

<blockquote class="page_quote">
	“I especially wanted to leverage my expertise in front-end development with a specific client niche - holistic entrepreneurs.”
</blockquote>

<p>Around the same time, I felt compelled to pursue an ongoing dream as well - to become a freelance web developer. For a long time I had been drawn to freelancing so I could work on projects and subjects that mean most to me. I especially wanted to leverage my expertise in front-end development with a specific client niche - holistic entrepreneurs.</p>

<p>Most importantly, having my own development and design business meant having more creative freedom and flexibility to enjoy a thriving work-life balance.</p>

<p>Appropriately, we discovered the opportunity to intersect both our personal callings. I decided then, it was only fitting I develop websites with a focus on helping like-minded clients on the same path as our family: holistic and alternative entrepreneurs ready to launch their own company websites. </p>

<p>So on the fateful day of the total solar eclipse of 2017, when the Earth, Moon, and Sun wondrously aligned, we commemorated the rare celestial event by formally branding our businesses with lunar references - Lotus Light Moon and Gray Mint Moon.</p>

<p>This began the narrative of how our passion for wanting to help others crossed over into the business world. These endeavors were born by following our hearts and our intuitions, and by responding to the signs of the Universe.</p>

<h5 class="page_section_title text_center">What Gray Mint Moon Means to Us</h5>

<p>With good intentions and the determination to do meaningful work, we're now living out our dreams by pursuing this next body of work, leveraging our natural gifts, activating our passions, and helping others pursue their own callings to make a positive impact around the world.</p>

<h5 class="page_section_title text_center">Gray Mint Moon Ahead</h5>

<p>We foresee our futures with fruitful online businesses, expanding our services to serve international clients, maintaining lots of time together as a close-knit family, extending our talents and gifts for the greater good, doing what we absolutely love, traveling all over this beautiful world, and continuing to work alongside kindred spirits like you!</p>
