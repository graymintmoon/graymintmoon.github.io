	<p class="faq_question">What is the value in hiring a custom web developer versus building a website myself?</p>
	<p class="faq_response">As makers and independent thinkers ourselves, we absolutely encourage everyone to dive in and create their own website - we find it pretty fun. You'll want to hire a developer when:</p>
	<ul class="page_bulleted_list">
		<li>You want to <strong class="text_charcoal">save time</strong> to focus on other things you value</li>
		<li>You aren't too interested in the <strong class="text_charcoal">technical aspects</strong> of code or design</li>
		<li>You want a <strong class="text_charcoal">customized website</strong> that will stand out and represent your brand</li>
		<li>You want a <strong class="text_charcoal">real professional</strong> website that works on any device</li>
	</ul>

	<p class="faq_question">How much will my website cost?</p>
	<p class="faq_response">We want to keep your costs as fair as possible. Our pricing strategy is purely based on the scope and complexity of what's needed - check out <a href="/services"><strong>Services page</strong></a> to see what we can do for you.</p>

	<p class="faq_question">How long will my project take?</p>
	<p class="faq_response">We are committed to working as efficiently as possible - the length of the project is largely dependent on the requirements of your website.</p>

	<p class="faq_question">Who will create the design for my website?</p>
	<p class="faq_response">Every website we do will come with out-of-the-box styling. If you need customized work done, we can help with design. Please mention that information in the <a href="/contact"><strong>Contact Form</strong></a> and we'll be happy to work with you.</p>
