			<p class="faq_question">What is the value in hiring a web developer versus building a website myself?</p>
			<p class="faq_response">As makers and independent thinkers ourselves, we absolutely encourage everyone to dive in and create their own website - we find it pretty fun. You'll want to hire a developer when:</p>
			<ul class="page_bulleted_list">
				<li>You want to <strong>save time</strong> to focus on other priorities you value</li>
				<li>You are overwhelmed by the <strong>technical aspects</strong> of code or design</li>
				<li>You want a <strong>customized website</strong> that represents your brand</li>
				<li>You want a <strong>real professional</strong> website that works on any device</li>
			</ul>

			<p class="faq_question">How do I get started?</p>
			<p class="faq_response">We want to make the process of collaboration as smooth as possible - our entire process can be broken down into easy-to-understand steps:</p>
			<ol class="page_bulleted_list">
				<li><strong>Submit questionnaire: </strong>fill out our <a href="/contact"><strong>contact form</strong></a> to get going.</li>
				<li><strong>Discovery conversation:</strong> we follow up with a call to better understand you, your brand, and your goals.</li>
				<li><strong>Dev & Design Treatment:</strong> we offer a free analysis and proposal of what we envision given your goals for your newly minted site.</li>
				<li><strong>Sign contract:</strong> we'll send a contract for you to review and sign.
				</li>
				<li><strong>Invoice and payment: </strong>once you've signed our contract, we'll send you an invoice.</li>
			</ol>

			<p class="faq_question">What is your work process like?</p>
			<p class="faq_response">Our process for creating a website can be boiled down to the following phases:</p>
			<ul class="page_bulleted_list">
				<li><strong>Discovery: </strong> it's critical to recognize your brand, business objectives, and target audience. From a design standpoint, this is one of the most important stages.</li>
				<li><strong>Concepting & Design: </strong> we design high-level concepts of what your site should include, mindful of user experience strategies.</li>
				<li><strong>Implementation: </strong>once we have some design artifacts, we can begin developing (coding) different pages, layouts, and user interface elements.</li>
				<li><strong>Iteration: </strong> during the implementation phase, we revisit design and user experience; if necessary, we iterate with better ideas.</li>
				<li><strong>Testing: </strong> although testing occurs throughout the entire process, we do deeper testing across the entire site to ensure everything is functioning optimally.</li>
